# Movie Recommending Website
#### Video Demo:  
#### Description:
My project is a movie recommender which collects information from the user and uses it to procure a list of films
that they might like using trees. The project uses Python, SQL, Flask, HTML, and CSS, and the database recommendations.db
which I created myself. The required libraries are listed in requirements.txt.
